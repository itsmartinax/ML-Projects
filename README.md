# Machine-Learning-projects
In this repository there are some machine learning projects. This is the result of the specialization course of courser about machine learning. The datasets are provided by kaggle. 

## MERCEDES BENZ PROJECT
In this project, we have analyzed a dataset containing information on the prices of various Mercedes Benz models along with related features (such as model, review count, number of doors, etc.). Our main goal is to create a regression model to predict the price of a particular car model. We have followed the data science workflow:

1. Loading and Reading the Dataset
2. Domain Understanding
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Data Preprocessing
5. Model Building
6. Model Evaluation
