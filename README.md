# Machine-Learning-Projects
In this repository, you will find several machine learning projects, which are the result of the Machine Learning specialization course on Coursera. The datasets used in these projects are provided by Kaggle.

## MERCEDES BENZ PROJECT
In this project, we have analyzed a dataset containing information on the prices of various Mercedes Benz models along with related features (such as model, review count, number of doors, etc.). Our main goal is to create a regression model to predict the price of a particular car model. We have followed the data science workflow:
1. Loading and Reading the Dataset
2. Domain Understanding
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Data Preprocessing
5. Model Building
6. Model Evaluation

## HEART DISEASE PROJECT
The dataset is publicly available on the Kaggle website and originates from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. The classification goal is to predict whether a patient has a 10-year risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD). The dataset contains information on over 4,000 patients and includes 15 attributes.
